Lets Get Classy

Class based component: old way
show information of team members on About page
first create functional component then convert it to class component

React.Component

#How to pass props
create constructor in Class
constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        console.log(props);
    }
    
<h1>h1{this.props.name}</h1>

#Hooks
no hooks in class component
state variables are created in Constructor this.state=Obj (example this.state={count: 1,count2: 2,} )state is reserve word, it contains all state variables

#Update the state variables
can't update directly this.state.count=1;
this.setState({count: this.state.count+1,count2: this.state.count2+1})

#LIFECYCLE of Class Based Component
Loading/Mounting same thing

1. Load/Mount

1. Constructor
2. Render
3. component Did Mount (to make API call)


1 parent and 2 or more child
Mounting phase
Render phase => 1. constructor 2. render
Commit phase => updates DOM and refs in a single batch (because DOM manipulation is costly operation)

#How to Make API call
make did mount function as async

#How to Update JSON data to web page
make state variable

MOUNTING:
Constructor (Dummy)
Render (Dummy)
        HTML (Dummy)
Component Did Mount
    API call
    this.setState => state variable is updated

UPDATE:
Render (API data)
HTML (API data)
Component Did Update

ComponentWillUnmount will be called when Component unmount from page
