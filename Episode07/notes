Episode 07 Finding The Path

useEffect
useEffect will be called everytime when the component renders, but to change this behaviour we pass dependency array, 
if dependency array is empty it will render only one time after page renders 1st time, 
if dependency array contains some data it will renders as the data updates

useEffect
It should be created in Component not outside

Routes:
Routing configuration at Root level
createBrowserRouter => contains list of paths (path,element,errorElement)

RouterProvider => provide routing configuration to App (<RouterProvider router={appRouter}>)

Children Layout of AppLayout
children => contains list of paths
Outlet will be filled according to path

use Link component to redirect to path
dont use a href, it will reload page

2 types of Routing in web apps
1. Client side (React) 
2. Server side
