React.createElement => is a JS Object => after rendering it becomes HTML element

but it is tedious task, not developer friendly

JSX is solution for above problem
JSX is a JS syntax which is easier to create React Elements
JSX is not a fundamental part of React 

JSX is a convention where we merge HTML and JS together
JSX is HTML like syntax

created using React const heading = React.createElement("h1",{},"React");
created using JSX const heading = <h1>React</h1>
both are same

process initiated by parcel but using Babel => JSX code transpiled(converting code in browser understandle format) before it reaches to JS Engine
JSX to createReactElement done by Babel
JSX => React.createElement => is a JS Object => after rendering it becomes HTML element
